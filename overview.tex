\section{Overview of the XTAG System}
\label{overview}

This chapter {This chapter is derived in large part from the XTAG Project Notes
\cite{Xtag-notes}.  An additional section on Corpus Parsing and Evaluation has
not been replicated here.} focuses on the various components that comprise the
parser and English grammar in the XTAG system.  Persons interested only in the
linguistic analyses in the grammar skip this section without loss of
continuity, although we may occasionally refer back to the various components
mentioned here.

\subsection{System Description}

Figure~{\ref{flowchart}} shows the overall flow of the system when parsing a
sentence. The input sentence is submitted to the {\bf Morphological Analyzer}
and the {\bf Tagger}. The morphological analyzer retrieves the morphological
information for each individual word in the sentence from the morphological
database. The result is filtered in the {\bf P.O.S Blender} using the output of
the trigram tagger to reduce the part-of-speech ambiguity of the words. The
augmented sentence, with each word annotated with part-of-speech tags and
morphological information, is input to the {\bf Parser}, which then consults
the syntactic database and tree database to retrieve the appropriate tree
structures for each word in the sentence.  Information from the statistical
database, along with a variety of heuristics, is used to reduce the number of
trees selected. The parser then composes the structures to obtain the parse(s)
of the sentence.

\subsection{Morphological Analyzer}

The morphology data was originally extracted from 1979 edition of the Collins
English Dictionary and Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary of Current English,
and then cleaned up and augmented by hand \cite{karp92}.  It consists of
approximately 317,000 inflected items, along with their root forms and
inflectional information (such as case, number, tense).  Thirteen different
parts-of-speech are differentiated: Noun, Proper Noun, Pronoun, Verb, Verb
Particle, Adverb, Adjective, Preposition, Complementizer, Determiner,
Conjunction, Interjection, and Noun/Verb Contraction.  Nouns and Verbs are the
largest categories, with approximately 213,000 and 46,500 inflected forms
respectively.  This information is maintained in database form for quick
access.  Retrieval time for a given inflected entry is approximately .6 msec.

\subsection{Part-of-Speech Tagger}

A trigram part-of-speech tagger \cite{kwc88}, trained on the Wall Street
Journal Corpus, is incorporated in XTAG. The trigram tagger has been extended to
output the N-best parts-of-speech sequences \cite{soong90}.  XTAG uses this
information to reduce the number of specious parses by filtering the possible
parts-of-speech provided by the morphological analyzer for each word.  The
tagger decreases the time to parse a sentence by an average of 93\%.

\subsection{Parser}

XTAG uses an Earley-style parser which has been extended to handle
feature structures associated with trees \cite{schabes90}. The parser uses a
general two-pass parsing strategy for `lexicalized' grammars \cite{schabes88}.
In the tree-selection pass, the parser uses the syntactic database entry for
each lexical item in the sentence to select a set of elementary structures from
the tree database.  The tree-grafting pass composes the selected trees using
substitution and adjunction operations to obtain the parse of the sentence.
The output of the parser for the sentence {\it I had a map yesterday} is
illustrated in Figure~\ref{sentence}. The parse tree\footnote{The feature
structures associated with each note of the parse tree are not shown here.}
represents the surface constituent structure, while the derivation tree
represents the derivation history of the parse. The nodes of the derivation
tree are the tree names anchored by the lexical items\footnote{Appendix
\ref{tree-naming} explains the conventions used in naming the trees.}.  The
composition operation is indicated by the nature of the arcs; a dashed line is
used for substitution and a bold line for adjunction.  The number beside each
tree name is the address of the node at which the operation took place.  The
derivation tree can also be interpreted as a dependency graph with unlabeled
arcs between words of the sentence.

\end{tabular}

\end{figure}

Additional methods that take advantage of FB-LTAGs have been implemented to
improve the performance of the parser.  For instance, the span\footnote{The
{\bf span} of a tree is the number of terminals and non-terminals along its
frontier.} of the tree and the position of the anchor in the tree are used to
weed out unsuitable trees in the first pass of the parser.  Statistical
information about the usage frequency of the trees has been acquired by parsing
corpora. This information has been compiled into a statistical database that is
used by the parser. These methods speed the runtime by approximately 87\%.

\subsection{Syntactic Database}
\label{description-syn-entries}

The syntactic database associates lexical items with the appropriate trees and
tree families based on various selectional information.  The syntactic database
entries were originally extracted from the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary
and Oxford Dictionary for Contemporary Idiomatic English, and then modified and
augmented by hand.  There are more than 37,000 syntactic database entries.
Selected entries from this database are shown in Table~\ref{syn-entries}.

Each syntactic entry consists of an {\sc index} field, the uninflected form
under which the entry is compiled in the database, an {\sc entry} field, which
contains all of the lexical items that will anchor the associated tree(s), a
{\sc pos} field, which gives the part-of-speech for the lexical item(s) in the
{\sc entry} field, and then either (but not both) a {\sc trees} or {\sc fam}
field.  The {\sc trees} field indicates a list of individual trees to be
associated with the entry, while the {\sc fam} field indicates a list of tree
families. A tree family may contain a number of trees.  A syntactic entry may
also contain a list of feature templates ({\sc fs}) which expand out to feature
equations to be placed in the specified tree(s). Any number of {\sc ex} fields
may be provided for example sentences. Note that lexical items may have more
than one entry and may select the same tree more than once, using different
features to capture lexical idiosyncrasies.

\subsection{Tree Database} 
\label{tree-db}
Trees in the English FB-LTAG framework fall into two conceptual classes.  The
smaller class consists of individual trees such as NP (Noun Phrase) and Adverb
trees.  The trees in this class are generally anchored by non-verbal lexical
items. The larger class consists of trees that are grouped into tree families.
These tree families represent subcategorization frames (see section
\ref{subcat-frames}).  As of Spring 1994, there are 385 trees that compose 40
tree families, along with 62 individually selected trees in the tree database.


\subsection{Statistics Database}
\label{stat-db}
The statistics database contains tree unigram frequencies which have been
collected by parsing the Wall Street Journal, IBM manual, and ATIS corpus using
the XTAG English grammar. The parser, augmented with the statistics database,
assigns each word of the input sentence the top three most frequently used
trees given the part-of-speech of the word. On failure the parser retries using
all the trees suggested by the syntactic database for each word.  The augmented
parser has been observed to have a success rate of 50\% without retries.

\subsection{X-Interface}

In addition to the parser and English grammar, XTAG provides a graphical
interface for manipulating TAGs.  The interface offers the following:

\begin{itemize}

\item Menu-based facility for creating and modifying tree files and 
loading grammar files.

\item User controlled parser parameters, including the parsing of
categories (S, embedded S, NP, DetP), and the use of the tagger (on/off/retry
on failure).

\item Storage/retrieval facilities for elementary and parsed trees as
text files.

\item The production of postscript files corresponding to elementary
and parsed trees.

\item Graphical displays of tree and feature data structures,
including a scroll `web' for large tree structures.

\item Mouse-based tree editor for creating and modifying trees and
feature structures.

\item Hand combination of trees by adjunction or substitution for use
in diagnosing grammar problems.

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Computer Platform}

XTAG was developed on the Sun SPARC station series, and has been tested on the
Sun 4 and HP BOBCATs series 9000.  It is available through anonymous ftp, and
requires 20MB of space.  Please send mail to xtag-request@linc.cis.upenn.edu
for ftp instructions or more information.  XTAG requires the following software
to run:

\begin{itemize}

\item A machine running UNIX and X11R4. Previous releases of X will
not work.  X11R4 is free software available from MIT.

\item A Common Lisp compiler which supports the latest definition of Common 
Lisp (Steele's Common Lisp, second edition).  XTAG has been tested with Lucid
Common Lisp 4.0 and Allegro 4.0.1.


\item CLX version 4 or higher. CLX is the lisp equivalent to the Xlib package 
written in C.

\item Mark Kantrowitz's Lisp Utilities from CMU: logical-pathnames and
defsystem.

\end{itemize}

The latest version of CLX (R5.0) and the CMU Lisp Utilities are provided in our
ftp directory for your convenience.  However, we ask that you refer to the
appropriate source for updates.

The morphology database component \cite{karp92}, no longer under licensing
restrictions, is available as a separate system from the XTAG system.  Ftp
instructions and more information can be obtained by mailing requests to
lex-request@linc.cis.upenn.edu.
