\section{Agreement}
{\bf $\langle$agr$\rangle$} is a complex feature.
It can have as its subfeatures:\\
{\bf $\langle$agr 3rdsing$\rangle$}, possible values: {\bf $+/-$ }\\
{\bf $\langle$agr num$\rangle$}, possible values: {\bf $plur,sing$ }\\
{\bf $\langle$agr pers$\rangle$}, possible values: {\bf $1,2,3$ }\\
{\bf $\langle$agr gen$\rangle$}, possible values: {\bf $masc,fem,neut$ }

These features are used to ensure agreement between a verb and its subject.

Where does it occur:\\ Nouns comes specified from the lexicon with
their {\bf $\langle$agr$\rangle$} features. e.g. {\em books} is {\bf
$\langle$agr 3rdsing$\rangle$:~--}, {\bf $\langle$agr num$\rangle$:~plur}, and {\bf $\langle$agr pers$\rangle$:~3}. Only pronouns use the
{\bf $<$gen$>$} (gender) feature.

The {\bf $\langle$agr$\rangle$} features of a noun are transmitted up the 
NP tree by the following equation:\\
{\bf NP.b:$\langle$agr$\rangle =$ N.t:$\langle$agr$\rangle$}

Agreement between a verb and its subject is mediated by the following feature
equations:

\enumsentence{ {\bf NP$_{subj}$:$\langle$agr$\rangle =$ VP.t:$\langle$agr$\rangle$}}


\enumsentence{ {\bf VP.b:$\langle$agr$\rangle =$ V.t:$\langle$agr$\rangle$}}

Agreement has to be done as a two step process because whether the
verb agrees with the subject or not depends upon whether some auxiliary verb
adjoins in and upon what the {\bf $\langle$agr$\rangle$} specification of 
the verb is. 

Verbs also come specified from the lexicon with their {\bf
$\langle$agr$\rangle$} features, e.g. the {\bf $\langle$agr$\rangle$}
features of the verb {\em sings} are {\bf $\langle$agr
3rdsing$\rangle$:~+}, {\bf $\langle$agr num$\rangle$:~sing}, and {\bf
$\langle$agr pers$\rangle$:~3}; Non-finite forms of the verb {\em
sing} e.g. {\em singing} do not come with an {\bf
$\langle$agr$\rangle$} feature specification.

\subsection{Agreement and Movement}
The {\bf $\langle$agr$\rangle$} features of a moved NP and its trace 
are co-indexed. This captures the fact that movement does not disrupt 
a pre-existing agreement relationship between an NP and a verb.

\section{Case}

\subsection{Approaches to Case}
\subsubsection{Case in GB theory}

GB (Government and Binding) theory proposes the following
`case filter' as a requirement on S-structure.\footnote{There are certain
problems with applying the case filter as a requirement at the level of
S-structure.  These issues are not crucial to the discussion of the English
XTAG implementation of case and so will not be discussed here.  Interested
readers are referred to
\cite{lasnik-uriagereka88}.}

\begin{verse}
\xtagdef{Case Filter:}
Every overt NP must be assigned abstract case. \cite{haegeman91}
\end{verse}

Abstract case is taken to be universal.  Languages with rich morphological case
marking, such as Latin, and languages with very limited morphological case
marking, like English, are all presumed to have full systems of abstract case
that differ only in the extent of morphological realization.

In GB, abstract case is argued to be assigned to NP's by various case
assigners, namely verbs, prepositions, and INFL.  Verbs and
prepositions are said to assign accusative case to NP's that they
govern, and INFL assigns nominative case to NP's that it governs.
These governing categories are constrained as to where they can assign
case by means of `barriers' based on `minimality conditions', although
these are relaxed in `exceptional case marking' situations.  The
details of the GB analysis are beyond the scope of this technical
report, but see \cite{chomsky86} for the original analysis or
\cite{haegeman91} for an overview.  Let it suffice for us to say that
the notion of abstract case and the case filter are useful in
accounting for a number of phenomena including the distribution of
nominative and accusative case, and the distribution of overt NP's and
empty categories (such as PRO).

\subsubsection{Minimalism and Case} 

A major conceptual difference between GB theories and Minimalism is that in
Minimalism, lexical items carry their features with them rather than being
assigned their features in the course of the derivation.  For example, nouns
have a case feature when it comes into the derivation. This feature is
`checked' in a particular configuration (in SPEC position of AGR$_s$ or
AGR$_o$) and then deleted. If the feature is not checked
(deleted), the derivation fails.\cite{chomsky92}

\subsection{Case in XTAG}

The English XTAG grammar adopts the notion of case and the case filter for many
of the same reasons argued in the GB literature.  However, in some respects the
English XTAG grammar's implementation of case more closely resembles the
treatment in Chomsky's Minimalism framework \cite{chomsky92} than the system
outlined in the GB literature \cite{chomsky86}.  As in Minimalism, nouns in
the XTAG grammar carry case with them, which is eventually `checked'. However,
in the XTAG grammar, noun cases are checked against the case values assigned
by the verb during the unification of the feature structures.  Unlike Chomsky's
Minimalism, there are no separate AGR nodes; the case checking comes from the
verbs directly. Case assignment from the verb is more like the GB approach than
the requirement of a SPEC-head relationship in Minimalism.

There are two features responsible for case-assignment:\\
{\bf $\langle$case$\rangle$}, possible values: {\bf nom, acc, gen, none}\\
{\bf $\langle$assign-case$\rangle$}, possible values: {\bf nom, acc, none}

Case assigners (prepositions and verbs) as well as the VP, S and PP
nodes that dominate them have an {\bf $\langle$assign-case$\rangle$}
case feature. Phrases and lexical items that have case i.e. Ns and NPs
have a {\bf $\langle$case$\rangle$} feature.

\subsubsection{Lexical Noun Phrases}

Most nouns in English do not have separate forms for nominative and accusative
case, and so they are ambiguous between the two.  Pronouns, of course, are
morphologically marked for case, and each carries the appropriate case in its
feature.  Figures~\ref{nouns-with-case}(a) and \ref{nouns-with-case}(b) show
the NP tree anchored by a noun and a pronoun, respectively, along with the
feature values associated with each word.  Note that {\it books} simply gets
the default case {\bf nom/acc}, while {\it she} restricts the case to be {\bf
nom}.

\subsubsection{Case Assigners}

Case is assigned in the XTAG English grammar by two lexical categories
- verbs and prepositions.\footnote{{\it For} also assigns case as a
complementizer.  See section \ref{for-complementizer} for more
details.}

\begin{flushleft}
{\bf $\bullet$ Prepositions}
\end{flushleft}

Prepositions assign accusative case ({\bf acc}) through
their {\bf $<$assign-case$>$} feature, which is specified in the lexicon.

\enumsentence{ {\bf P.b:$\langle$assign-case$\rangle =$ acc}}

This feature is linked directly to the
{\bf $<$case$>$} feature of their objects, which is accomplished with 
the following feature equations:

\enumsentence{ {\bf PP.b:$\langle$assign-case$\rangle =$ P.t:$\langle$assign-case$\rangle$}}


\enumsentence{ {\bf NP.t:$\langle$case$\rangle =$ P.t:$\langle$assign-case$\rangle$}}

Figure~\ref{PXPnx-with-case}(a) shows a lexicalized preposition tree,
while Figure~\ref{PXPnx-with-case}(b) shows the same tree with the NP
tree from Figure~\ref{nouns-with-case}(a) substituted into the NP
position.  Figure~\ref{PXPnx-with-case}(c) is the tree in
Figure~\ref{PXPnx-with-case}(b) after unification has taken place.
Note that the case ambiguity of {\it books} has been resolved to
accusative case.

\end{figure}

\begin{flushleft}
{\bf $\bullet$ Verbs}
\end{flushleft}

Verbs are the other part of speech in the XTAG grammar that can assign case.
Because XTAG does not distinguish INFL and VP nodes, verbs must provide case
assignment on the subject position in addition to the case assigned to their NP
complements.

Assigning case to NP complements is handled by building the case values of the
complements directly into the tree that the case assigner (the verb) anchors.
Figures~\ref{S-tree-with-case}(a) and \ref{S-tree-with-case}(b) show an S
tree\footnote{Features not pertaining to this discussion have been taken out to
improve readability and to make the trees easier to fit onto the page.} that
would be anchored\footnote{The diamond marker ($\diamond$) indicates the
anchor(s) of a structure if the tree has not yet been lexicalized.} by a
transitive and ditransitive verb, respectively.  Note that the case assignments
for the NP complements are already in the tree, even though there is not yet a
lexical item anchoring the tree.  Since every verb that selects these trees
(and other trees in each respective subcategorization frame) assigns the same
case to the complements, building case features into the tree has exactly the
same result as putting the case feature value in each verb's lexical
entry. \ex{1} shows the equation used for specifying accusative case on the
object NP (where {\it object} is replaced by an underscore and the number of
the argument -- either 1 or 2 -- which is getting accusative case).
\begin{figure}[htb]

\label{2;1,1}
\label{2;1,3}
\end{figure}

\enumsentence{ {\bf NP$_{object}$.t:$\langle$case$\rangle =$ acc}}

The case assigned to the subject position varies with verb form.  Since the
XTAG grammar treats the inflected verb as a single unit rather than dividing it
into INFL and V nodes, case, along with tense and agreement, is expressed in
the features of verbs, and must be passed in the appropriate manner.  The trees
in Figure~\ref{lexicalized-S-tree-with-case} show the path of linkages that
joins the {\bf$<$assign-case$>$} feature of the V to the {\bf $<$case$>$}
feature of the subject NP.  The morphological form of the verb determines the
value of the {\bf $<$assign-case$>$} feature.
Figures~\ref{lexicalized-S-tree-with-case}(a) and
\ref{lexicalized-S-tree-with-case}(b) show the same tree\footnote{Again, the 
feature structures shown have been restricted to those that pertain to the V/NP
interaction.} anchored by different morphological forms of the verb {\it sing},
which give different values for the {\bf $<$assign-case$>$} feature.
Tensed verbs assign case {\bf nom}, whereas non-tensed verbs assign no case at
all; that is, a verb such as {\it singing} has no {\bf $<$assign-case$>$}
feature. 

Assignment of case to the subject involves the following two equations.

\enumsentence{ {\bf NP$_{subj}$:$\langle$case$\rangle =$ VP.t:$\langle$assign-case$\rangle$}}

\enumsentence{ {\bf VP.b:$\langle$assign-case$\rangle =$ V.t:$\langle$assign-case$\rangle$}}

\caption {Proper case assignment with auxiliary verbs}
\label{Vvx-with-case}
\end{figure}

In the case of a tenseless verb, a tensed auxiliary will adjoin in and assign
case to the subject, or the subject will be assigned accusative from a higher
ECM verb.\footnote{Currently, there is nothing in the grammar which acts as a
Case Filter to rule out sentences with nouns that are not receiving
case. Thus, sentences such as {\it $\ast$I hope Carlos to be happy} are
accepted, even though the NP {\it Carlos} does not receive case. We are
exploring ways of handling this for future releases.}
Figure~\ref{Vvx-with-case}(a) shows the auxiliary tree for {\it is}, and
Figure~\ref{Vvx-with-case}(b) shows the result of adjoining {\it is} into the
transitive tree anchored by {\it singing}. The case feature on the subject NP
has the value {\bf $<$nom$>$}, which comes from the auxiliary verb {\it is}. 

\subsubsection{PRO}

In GB theory, the null NP element PRO can only appear in positions where it
does not receive case (and in fact, where it is ungoverned). PRO only appears
in subject position of tenseless (non-matrix) clauses, where the clause is
either an adjunct, as in \ex{1}, or a CP infinitival complement clause, as in
\ex{2}. Since only tensed verbs can assign nominative case, a PRO in the
subject position of a tenseless clause will not receive nominative case. PRO
also cannot appear in the complement of an ECM verb, since ECM verbs assign
accusative case to the subject of their complement clause.

\enumsentence{While PRO talking to Anoop, Carlos drank a coke.}
\enumsentence{Tonia wants PRO to eat lunch.}

In previous versions of the grammar, the distribution of PRO was controlled by
case features, similar to its treatment GB theory. PRO anchored an NP initial
tree and had the case feature {\bf none}. This tree could substitute into NP
positions, but only unify in a position where either case {\bf none} or no case
at all was assigned, but not in positions with case {\bf nom} or {\bf acc}.

Currently, however, we have dispensed with PRO as an anchoring element, and
tenseless verbs no longer have the feature {\bf
$<$assign-case$>$=none}. Rather than substituting in, PRO is built into the
subject position of the relevant sentential (and gerund) trees.\footnote{In
this, we follow the treatment of PRO in the French XTAG project
\cite{ACK00}.} \footnote{Note that, as of the Spring 2001 release, not all
the PRO trees had been included in the grammar. Thus, some necessary trees
are missing.}

The distribution of PRO is still controlled by case features to some degree,
however. The trees with PRO built-in have an {\bf $<$assign-case$>$=none}
feature in the root S node (rather than being assigned by the verb). By having
this feature, we can make sure that the PRO tree cannot appear as the
complement of an ECM verb, since it will clash with the ECM verb's {\bf
$<$assign-case$>$=acc} feature. The equations in the PRO trees are given in
\ex{1} and \ex{2}.

\enumsentence{ {\bf NP$_{subj}$:$<$case$>$ = none}}

\enumsentence{ {\bf S$_r$.b:$<$case$>$ = NP$_{subj}$:$<$case$>$}}


\subsubsection{ECM}
Certain verbs, such as {\em want, believe, consider}, and one complementizer
({\em for}) are able to assign case to the subject of their complement clause. 

The complementizer {\em for}, like the preposition {\em for}, has the
{\bf $\langle$assign-case$\rangle$} feature of its complement set to
{\bf acc}. Since the {\bf $\langle$assign-case$\rangle$} feature of
the root S$_{r}$ of the complement tree and the {\bf
$\langle$case$\rangle$} feature of its NP subject are co-indexed, this
leads to the subject being assigned accusative case.

ECM verbs have the {\bf $\langle$assign-case$\rangle$}  feature of their
foot S node set to {\bf acc}. The co-indexation between the 
{\bf $\langle$assign-case$\rangle$} feature of
the root S$_{r}$ and the {\bf $\langle$case$\rangle$} feature of the NP subject
leads to the subject being assigned accusative case.

\subsubsection{The Case of Extracted NPs}
The {\bf $\langle$case$\rangle$} features of a moved NP and its trace 
are co-indexed. This captures the fact that movement does not disrupt 
a pre-existing relationship of case-assignment between a verb and an NP.

\section{Extraction and Inversion}

\subsection{Extraction}
{\bf $\langle$extracted$\rangle$}, possible vales are {\bf $+/-$}

All sentential trees with extracted components, with the exception of
relative clauses are marked {\bf S.b$\langle$extracted$\rangle = +$}
at their top S node. The extracted element may be a {\em wh}-NP or a
topicalized NP. The {\bf $\langle$extracted$\rangle$} feature 
is currently used to block embedded topicalizations as exemplified
by the following example.
\enumsentence{ * John wants [Bill$_{i}$ [PRO to leave t$_{i}$]] }

\noindent
{\bf $\langle$trace$\rangle$}: this feature is not assigned any value and
is used to co-index moved NPs and their traces which are marked by
$\epsilon$.

\noindent
{\bf $\langle$wh$\rangle$}: possible values are {\bf $+/-$}\\ NPs like
{\em who}, {\em what} etc. come marked from the lexicon with a value
of {\bf $+$} for the feature {\bf $\langle$wh$\rangle$}.  Non {\em
wh}-NPs have {\bf $-$} as the value of their {\bf
$\langle$wh$\rangle$} feature. Note that {\bf $\langle$wh$\rangle$ = +
} NPs are not restricted to occurring in extracted positions, to allow
for the correct treatment of echo questions.

The {\bf $\langle$wh$\rangle$} feature is propagated up by possessives
-- e.g. the $+$ {\bf $\langle$wh$\rangle$} feature of the determiner
{\em which} in {\em which boy} is propagated up to the level of the NP
so that the value of the {\bf $\langle$wh$\rangle$} feature of the
entire NP is $+${\bf $\langle$wh$\rangle$}. This process is recursive
e.g. {\em which boy's mother}, {\em which boy's mother's sister}.

The {\bf $\langle$wh$\rangle$} feature
is also propagated up PPs. Thus the PP {\em to whom} has $+$ as the value of its 
{\bf $\langle$wh$\rangle$} feature. 

In trees with extracted NPs, the {\bf $\langle$wh$\rangle$} feature of the
root node S node is equated with the {\bf $\langle$wh$\rangle$} feature
of the extracted NPs. 

The {\bf $\langle$wh$\rangle$} feature is used to impose
subcategorizational constraints.
Certain verbs like {\em wonder} can
only take interrogative complements, other verbs such as {\em know}
can take both interrogative and non-interrogative complements, and yet
other verbs like {\em think} can only take non-interrogative
complements (cf. the {\bf $\langle$extracted$\rangle$} and {\bf
$\langle$mode$\rangle$} features also play a role in imposing 
subcategorizational constraints).

The {\bf $\langle$wh$\rangle$} feature is also used to get the correct
inversion patterns.


\subsection{Inversion}
The following three features are used to ensure the correct pattern of
inversion:\\
{\bf $\langle$wh$\rangle$}: possible values are {\bf $+/-$}\\
{\bf $\langle$inv$\rangle$}: possible values are {\bf $+/-$}\\
{\bf $\langle$invlink$\rangle$}: possible values are {\bf $+/-$}

Facts to be captured:\\
1. No inversion with topicalization\\
2. No inversion with matrix extracted subject {\em wh}-questions\\
3. Inversion with matrix extracted object {\em wh}-questions\\
4. Inversion with all matrix {\em wh}-questions involving extraction from an
embedded clause\\
5. No inversion in embedded questions \\
6. No matrix subject topicalizations.

Consider a tree with object extraction, where NP is extracted. 
The following feature equations are used:\\

\enumsentence{ {\bf S$_{q}$.b:$\langle$wh$\rangle =$ NP.t:$\langle$wh$\rangle$}\label{inv1}}
\enumsentence{ {\bf S$_{q}$.b:$\langle$invlink$\rangle =$  S$_{q}$.b:$\langle$inv$\rangle$}\label{inv2}}
\enumsentence{ {\bf S$_{q}$.b:$\langle$inv$\rangle =$  S$_{r}$.t:$\langle$inv$\rangle$}\label{inv3}}
\enumsentence{ {\bf S$_{r}$.b:$\langle$inv$\rangle = -$}\label{inv4}}

\noindent
{\bf Root restriction}: A restriction is imposed on the final root
node of any XTAG derivation of a tensed sentence which equates the
{\bf $\langle$wh$\rangle$} feature and the {\bf
$\langle$invlink$\rangle$} feature of the final root node.

If the extracted NP is not a {\em wh}-word i.e. its {\bf
$\langle$wh$\rangle$} feature has the value $-$, at the end of the
derivation, {\bf S$_{q}$.b:$\langle$wh$\rangle$} will also have the
value $-$. Because of the root constraint {\bf
S$_{q}$.b:$\langle$wh$\rangle$} will be equated to {\bf
S$_{q}$.b:$\langle$invlink$\rangle$} which will also come to have the
value $-$. Then, by (\ref{inv3}), {\bf
S$_{r}$.t:$\langle$inv$\rangle$} will acquire the value $-$. This will
unify with {\bf S$_{r}$.b:$\langle$inv$\rangle$} which has the value
$-$ (cf. \ref{inv4}). Consequently, no auxiliary verb adjunction will
be forced. Hence, there will never be inversion in topicalization.

If the extracted NP is a {\em wh}-word i.e. its {\bf $\langle$wh$\rangle$} 
feature has the value $+$, at the end of the derivation, 
{\bf S$_{q}$.b:$\langle$wh$\rangle$} will also have the value $+$. Because of
the root constraint {\bf S$_{q}$.b:$\langle$wh$\rangle$} will be equated 
to {\bf S$_{q}$.b:$\langle$invlink$\rangle$} which will also come to have
the value $+$. Then, by (\ref{inv3}), {\bf S$_{r}$.t:$\langle$inv$\rangle$} 
will acquire the value $+$. This will not unify with {\bf S$_{r}$.b:$\langle$inv$\rangle$}
which has the value $+$ (cf. \ref{inv4}). Consequently, the adjunction
of an inverted auxiliary verb is required for the derivation to succeed.

Inversion will still take place even if the extraction is from an embedded
clause.

\enumsentence{ Who$_{i}$ does Loida think [Miguel likes t$_{i}$]}

This is because the adjoined tree's root node will also have its 
{\bf S$_{r}$.b:$\langle$inv$\rangle$} set to $-$. 


Note that inversion is only forced upon us because S$_{q}$ is the
final root node and the {\bf Root restriction} applies. In embedded
environments, the root restriction would not apply and the feature
clash that forces adjunction would not take place.

The {\bf $\langle$invlink$\rangle$} feature is not present in subject
extractions.  Consequently there is no inversion in subject questions.

Subject topicalizations are blocked by setting the 
{\bf $\langle$wh$\rangle$} feature of the extracted NP to $+$ i.e. only
{\em wh}-phrases can go in this location. 

%\subsection{Inversion, Part 2}

\section{Multi-component Adjoining}

{\bf $\langle$displ-const$\rangle$}:\\ Possible values: {\bf [set1: +], [set1:
--]}\\ This feature can be used to simulate multi-component
adjoining\footnote{The {\bf $\langle$displ-const$\rangle$} feature is also used
in the ECM analysis.} and was previously used this way in the analysis of
inversion. In the previous analysis, an empty verb trace tree adjoined in
at VP whenever an auxiliary verb tree adjoined at S.
However, we have dispensed with the empty verb tree and thus do not require a
multi-component analysis to account for inversion.

We leave a description of the feature here for possible future analyses of
phenomena which might require a multi-component analysis, such as
extraposition, for example. 

%In the previous section, we saw how inversion is
%triggered using the {\bf $\langle$invlink$\rangle$}, {\bf
%$\langle$inv$\rangle$}, {\bf $\langle$wh$\rangle$} features. Inversion
%involves movement of the verb from V to C. This movement process is
%represented using the {\bf $\langle$displ-const$\rangle$} feature
%which is used to simulate Multi-Component TAGs.\footnote{The {\bf
%$\langle$displ-const$\rangle$} feature is also used in the ECM
%analysis.} The sub-value {\bf set1} indicates the inversion
%multi-component set; while there are not currently any other uses of
%this mechanism, it could be expanded with other sets receiving
%different {\bf set} values.
%
The {\bf $\langle$displ-const$\rangle$} feature is used to ensure
adjunction of two trees.
% which in this case are the auxiliary
%tree corresponding to the moved verb (S adjunct) and the auxiliary tree
%corresponding to the trace of the moved verb (VP adjunct). 
The following equations are used:

\enumsentence{  {\bf S$_{r}$.b:$\langle$displ-const set1$\rangle = -$}\label{dis1}}
\enumsentence{  {\bf S.t:$\langle$displ-const set1$\rangle = +$}\label{dis2}}
\enumsentence{  {\bf VP.b:$\langle$displ-const set1$\rangle =$
          V.t:$\langle$displ-const set1$\rangle$}\label{dis3}}
\enumsentence{  {\bf V.b:$\langle$displ-const set1$\rangle = +$}\label{dis4}}
\enumsentence{  {\bf S$_{r}$.b:$\langle$displ-const set1$\rangle =$ 
          VP.t:$\langle$displ-const set1$\rangle$}\label{dis5}}


\section{Clause Type}
There are several features that mark clause type.\footnote{We have
already seen one instance of a feature that marks clause-type: {\bf
$\langle$extracted$\rangle$}, which marks whether a certain S involves
extraction or not.} They are:\\ {\bf $\langle$mode$\rangle$}\\ 
{\bf $\langle$passive$\rangle$}: possible values are {\bf +/--}

\noindent
{\bf $\langle$mode$\rangle$}: possible values are 
{\bf base, ger, ind, inf, imp, nom, ppart, prep, sbjnct}\\
The {\bf $\langle$mode$\rangle$} feature of a verb in its root form is
{\bf base}. The {\bf $\langle$mode$\rangle$} feature of a verb in its past 
participial form is {\bf ppart}, the {\bf $\langle$mode$\rangle$} feature of a 
verb in its progressive/gerundive form is {\bf ger}, 
the {\bf $\langle$mode$\rangle$} feature of a tensed verb is {\bf ind},
and the {\bf $\langle$mode$\rangle$} feature of a verb in the imperative 
is {\bf imp}. 

\noindent
{\bf nom} is the {\bf $\langle$mode$\rangle$} value of AP/NP
predicative trees headed by a null copula.  {\bf prep} is the {\bf
$\langle$mode$\rangle$} value of PP predicative trees headed by a null
copula.  Only the copula auxiliary tree, some sentential complement
verbs (such as {\it consider} and raising verb auxiliary trees have
{\bf nom/prep} as the {\bf $\langle$mode$\rangle$} feature
specification of their foot node. This allows them, and only them, to
adjoin onto AP/NP/PP predicative trees with null copulas.

\subsection{Auxiliary Selection}
The {\bf $\langle$mode$\rangle$} feature is also used to state the
subcategorizational constraints between an auxiliary verb and its
complement. We model the following constraints:\\
{\em have} takes past participial complements\\
passive {\em be} takes past participial complements\\
active {\em be} takes progressive complements\\
modal verbs, {\em do}, and {\em to} take VPs headed by verbs in their
base form as their complements. 

An auxiliary verb transmits its own mode to its root and imposes its
subcategorizational restrictions on its complement i.e. on its foot node.
e.g. the auxiliary {\em have} in its infinitival form involves the
following equations:

\enumsentence{ {\bf VP$_{r}$.b:$\langle$mode$\rangle =$ 
          V.t:$\langle$mode$\rangle$}\label{mode1}}
\enumsentence{ {\bf  V.t:$\langle$mode$\rangle =$ base}\label{mode2}}
\enumsentence{ {\bf VP.b:$\langle$mode$\rangle =$ ppart}\label{mode3}}

\noindent
{\bf $\langle$passive$\rangle$}: This feature is used to ensure that
passives only have {\em be} as their auxiliary. Passive trees start
out with their {\bf $\langle$passive$\rangle$} feature as {\bf +}.
This feature starts out at the level of the verb and is percolated up
to the level of the VP. This ensures that only auxiliary verbs whose
foot node has {\bf +} as their {\bf $\langle$passive$\rangle$} feature
can adjoin on a passive. Passive trees have {\bf ppart} as the value
of their {\bf $\langle$mode$\rangle$} feature. So the only auxiliary
trees that we really have to worry about blocking are trees whose foot
nodes have {\bf ppart} as the value of their {\bf
$\langle$mode$\rangle$} feature. There are two such trees -- the {\em
be} tree and the {\em have} tree. The {\em be} tree is fine because
its foot node has {\bf +} as its {\bf $\langle$passive$\rangle$}
feature, so both the {\bf $\langle$passive$\rangle$} and {\bf
$\langle$mode$\rangle$} values unify; the {\em have} tree is blocked
because its foot node has {\bf --} as its {\bf
$\langle$passive$\rangle$} feature.


\section{Complementizer Selection}
The following features are used to ensure the appropriate distribution
of complementizers:
\\
{\bf $\langle$comp$\rangle$}, possible values: {\bf that, if, whether,
for, inf\_nil, ind\_nil, nil}\\
{\bf $\langle$assign-comp$\rangle$}, possible values: {\bf that, if,
whether, for, ecm, ind\_nil, inf\_nil, none}\\
{\bf $\langle$mode$\rangle$}, possible values: {\bf ind, inf, sbjnct, ger, base, ppart, 
nom, prep}\\
{\bf $\langle$wh$\rangle$}, possible values: {\bf +, --}

The value of the {\bf $\langle$comp$\rangle$} feature tells us what complementizer we 
are dealing with. The trees which introduce complementizers come 
specified from the lexicon with their 
{\bf $\langle$comp$\rangle$} feature and {\bf $\langle$assign-comp$\rangle$} 
feature. The {\bf $\langle$comp$\rangle$} of the Comp tree regulates 
what kind of tree goes above the Comp tree, while the 
{\bf $\langle$assign-comp$\rangle$} feature regulates what kind of tree
goes below.
e.g.
the following equations are used for {\em that}:

\enumsentence{ {\bf S$_{c}$.b:$\langle$comp$\rangle =$ Comp.t:$\langle$comp$\rangle$} }
\enumsentence{ {\bf S$_{c}$.b:$\langle$wh$\rangle =$ Comp.t:$\langle$wh$\rangle$}}
\enumsentence{ {\bf S$_{c}$.b:$\langle$mode$\rangle =$ ind/sbjnct}}
\enumsentence{ {\bf S$_{r}$.t:$\langle$assign-comp$\rangle =$ Comp.t:$\langle$comp$\rangle$}}
\enumsentence{ {\bf S$_{r}$.b:$\langle$comp$\rangle =$ nil}}

By specifying {\bf S$_{r}$.b:$\langle$comp$\rangle =$ nil}, we ensure that
complementizers do not adjoin onto other complementizers. The root node
of a complementizer tree always has its {\bf $\langle$comp$\rangle$} feature
set to a value other than {\bf nil}.

Trees that take clausal complements specify with the {\bf $\langle$comp$\rangle$} feature
on their foot node what kind of complementizer(s) they can take. 
The {\bf $\langle$assign-comp$\rangle$} feature of an S node is determined 
by the highest VP below the S node and the syntactic configuration
the S node is in. 

\subsection{Verbs with object sentential complements}
Finite sentential complements:

\enumsentence{ {\bf S$_{1}$.t:$\langle$comp$\rangle =$ that/whether/if/nil}}
\enumsentence{{\bf S$_{1}$.t:$\langle$mode$\rangle =$ ind/sbjnct} or {\bf S$_{1}$.t:$\langle$mode$\rangle =$ ind}}
\enumsentence{ {\bf S$_{1}$.t:$\langle$assign-comp$\rangle =$ ind\_nil/inf\_nil}}

The presence of an overt complementizer is optional.

Non-finite sentential complements, do not permit {\em for}:

\enumsentence{ {\bf S$_{1}$.t:$\langle$comp$\rangle =$ nil}}
\enumsentence{ {\bf S$_{1}$.t:$\langle$mode$\rangle =$ inf}}
\enumsentence{ {\bf S$_{1}$.t:$\langle$assign-comp$\rangle =$ ind\_nil/inf\_nil}
}

Non-finite sentential complements, permit {\em for}:

\enumsentence{ {\bf S$_{1}$.t:$\langle$comp$\rangle =$ for/nil}}
\enumsentence{ {\bf S$_{1}$.t:$\langle$mode$\rangle =$ inf}}
\enumsentence{ {\bf S$_{1}$.t:$\langle$assign-comp$\rangle =$ ind\_nil/inf\_nil}}

Cases like `*I want for to win' are independently ruled out due to a 
case feature clash between the {\bf acc} assigned by {\em for} and the
intrinsic case feature {\bf none} on the PRO.

Non-finite sentential complements, ECM:

\enumsentence{ {\bf S$_{1}$.t:$\langle$comp$\rangle =$ nil}}
\enumsentence{ {\bf S$_{1}$.t:$\langle$mode$\rangle =$ inf}}
\enumsentence{ {\bf S$_{1}$.t:$\langle$assign-comp$\rangle =$ ecm}}


\subsection{Verbs with sentential subjects}
The following contrast involving complementizers surfaces with sentential
subjects:

\enumsentence{ *(That) John is crazy is likely.}

Indicative sentential subjects obligatorily have complementizers while
infinitival sentential subjects may or may not have a complementizer. 
Also {\em if} is possible as the complementizer of an object clause
but not as the complementizer of a sentential subject. 

\enumsentence{ {\bf S$_{0}$.t:$\langle$comp$\rangle =$ that/whether/for/nil}}
\enumsentence{ {\bf S$_{0}$.t:$\langle$mode$\rangle =$ inf/ind}}
\enumsentence{ {\bf S$_{0}$.t:$\langle$assign-comp$\rangle =$ inf\_nil}}

If the sentential subject is finite and a complementizer does
not adjoin in, the {\bf $\langle$assign-comp$\rangle$} feature of the 
S$_{0}$ node of the embedding clause and the root node of the
embedded clause will fail to unify. If a complementizer adjoins in,
there will be no feature-mismatch because the root of the
complementizer tree is not specified for the {\bf $\langle$assign-comp$\rangle$} feature.

The {\bf $\langle$comp$\rangle$} feature {\bf nil} is split into two
{\bf $\langle$assign-comp$\rangle$} features {\bf ind\_nil} and
{\bf inf\_nil} to capture the fact that there are certain configurations in
which it is acceptable for an infinitival clause to lack a complementizer
but not acceptable for an indicative clause to lack a complementizer. 

\subsection{{\em That}-trace and {\em for}-trace effects}

\enumsentence{ Who$_{i}$ do you think (*that) t$_{i}$ ate the apple?}

{\em That} trace violations are blocked by the presence of the following
equation:

\enumsentence{ {\bf S$_{r}$.b:$\langle$assign-comp$\rangle =$ inf\_nil/ind\_nil/ecm}}

on the bottom of the S$_{r}$ nodes of trees with extracted subjects (W0). 
The {\bf ind\_nil} feature specification permits the above example
while the {\bf inf\_nil/ecm} feature specification allows the
following examples to be derived:

\enumsentence{ Who$_{i}$ do you want [ t$_{i}$ to win the World Cup]?}
\enumsentence{ Who$_{i}$ do you consider [ t$_{i}$ intelligent]?}

The feature equation that ruled out the {\em that}-trace filter violations
will also serve to rule out the {\em for}-trace violations above.

\section{Relative Clauses}
Features that are peculiar to the relative clause system are:\\
{\bf $<$nocomp-mode$>$}, possible values are {\bf inf/ger/ppart}\\
{\bf $\langle$rel-clause$\rangle$}, possible values are {\bf +/--}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf $<$nocomp-mode$>$}:

Relative clauses which have subject extraction cannot have a null COMP,
unless there is an intervening clause or the relative clause is a reduced
relative ({\bf mode = inf/ppart/ger}). In order to ensure this, the top
feature set of the root node of the relative clause is specified for {\bf
$<$nocomp-mode$>$}={\bf inf/ger/ppart} in conjunction with the
following equations:

\enumsentence{{\bf S$_{r}$.t:$\langle$nocomp-mode$\rangle =$ inf/ger/ppart} (in
relative clause trees with subject extraction)}
\enumsentence{{\bf S$_{r}$.b:$\langle$nocomp-mode$\rangle =$
S$_{r}$.b:$\langle$mode$\rangle$}}

The full set of the equations above is only present in Comp
substitution trees involving subject extraction. So the following will
not be ruled out.

\enumsentence{
the toy [$\epsilon$$_{w}$ [$\epsilon$$_{C}$ [ Dafna likes t$_{i}$ ]]] }

The feature mismatch induced by the above equations is not remedied by
adjunction of just any S-adjunct because all other S-adjuncts are
transparent to the {\bf $\langle$nocomp-mode$\rangle$} feature because of the
following equation:

\enumsentence{
{\bf S$_{m}$.b:$\langle$nocomp-mode$\rangle =$S$_{f}$.t:$\langle$nocomp-mode$\rangle$}}

\item {\bf $\langle$rel-clause$\rangle$}:

The XTAG analysis forces the adjunction of the determiner below the
relative clause. This is done by using the {\bf
$\langle$rel-clause$\rangle$} feature. The relevant equations are:

\enumsentence{ On the root of the Relative clause: {\bf NP$_{r}$.b:$\langle$rel-clause$\rangle = +$}}
\enumsentence{ On the foot node of the 
Determiner tree: {\bf NP$_{f}$.t:$\langle$rel-clause$\rangle = -$}}

Relative clauses also use the {\bf $<$mode$>$} and the {\bf $<$comp$>$}
features in a manner largely parallel to the way they are used in
sentential complementation. Some of the feature specifications and
equations that are specific to relative clause formation are discussed
below:

\item Complementizers (which appear in relative clauses via adjunction)
can never cooccur with the overt extracted {\bf $+<$wh$>$} NP (cf. *{\it I
saw the man who$_i$ that Muriel saw $\epsilon$$_{i}$}).  Consequently, the
auxiliary $\beta$COMPs trees are prevented from adjoining at the {\bf
S$_r$} node in the relative clause trees by the equation

\enumsentence{{\bf S$_{r}$.t:$\langle$comp$\rangle =$ nil}}

which will always fail to unify with the (non-{\bf nil}) values of the {\bf
$<$comp$>$} feature in the $\beta$COMPs trees.

\item Relative clause trees that have {\bf NP$_{w}$} as a substitution
node have the feature equation given below.

\enumsentence{{\bf S$_{r}$.t:$\langle$mode$\rangle =$ind}}

\item Trees with a {\bf PP$_{w}$} substitution node have the feature
equation:

\enumsentence{{\bf S$_{r}$.t:$\langle$mode$\rangle =$ ind/inf}}

\item In relative clauses with covert extracted {\bf $+<$wh$>$ NP}, the
mode of relative clause varies depending on which argument has been
extracted. The full set of mode restrictions on the different relative
clause trees is as follows:

\enumsentence{For all non-passive cases of subject extraction, {\bf
S$_{r}$.t:$\langle$mode$\rangle =$ ind/ger/inf}}
\enumsentence{For all passive cases of subject extraction, {\bf
S$_{r}$.t:$\langle$mode$\rangle =$ ind/ger/ppart/inf}}
\enumsentence{For all cases of non-subject extraction, {\bf
S$_{r}$.t:$\langle$mode$\rangle =$ ind/inf}}

\end{itemize}

\section{Determiner ordering}
{\bf $\langle$card$\rangle$}, possible values are {\bf +, --}\\
{\bf $\langle$compl$\rangle$}, possible values are {\bf +, --}\\
{\bf $\langle$const$\rangle$}, possible values are {\bf +, --}\\
{\bf $\langle$decreas$\rangle$}, possible values are {\bf +, --}\\
{\bf $\langle$definite$\rangle$}, possible values are {\bf +, --}\\
{\bf $\langle$gen$\rangle$}, possible values are {\bf +, --}\\
{\bf $\langle$quan$\rangle$}, possible values are {\bf +, --}

For detailed discussion see Chapter \ref{det-comparitives}.

\section{Punctuation}
{\bf $\langle$punct$\rangle$} is a complex feature. It has the following
as its subfeatures:\\
{\bf $\langle$punct bal$\rangle$}, possible values are {\bf dquote,
squote, paren, nil}\\
{\bf $\langle$punct contains colon$\rangle$}, possible values are {\bf +, --}\\
{\bf $\langle$punct contains dash$\rangle$}, possible values are {\bf +, --}\\
{\bf $\langle$punct contains dquote$\rangle$}, possible values are {\bf +, --}\\
{\bf $\langle$punct contains scolon$\rangle$}, possible values are {\bf +, --}\\
{\bf $\langle$punct contains squote$\rangle$}, possible values are {\bf +, --}\\
{\bf $\langle$punct struct$\rangle$}, possible values are {\bf comma,
dash, colon, scolon, none, nil}\\
{\bf $\langle$punct term$\rangle$}, possible values are {\bf per, qmark, excl, 
none, nil}

For detailed discussion see Chapter~\ref{punct-chapt}.


\section{Conjunction}
{\bf $\langle$conj$\rangle$}, possible values are {\bf but, and, or,
comma, scolon, to, disc, nil}\\
The {\bf $\langle$conj$\rangle$} feature is specified in the lexicon
for each conjunction and is passed up to the root node 
of the conjunction tree. If the conjunction is {\em and}, the 
root {\bf $\langle$agr num$\rangle$} is {\bf $\langle$plural$\rangle$}, no
matter what the number of the two conjuncts. With {\em or}, the
the root {\bf $\langle$agr num$\rangle$} is equated to the
{\bf $\langle$agr num$\rangle$} feature of the right conjunct. 


The {\bf $\langle$conj$\rangle$=disc} feature is only used at the root
of  the
$\beta$CONJs tree.  It blocks the adjunction of one $\beta$CONJs tree
on another.  The following equations are used, where S$_{r}$ is
the substitution node and S$_{c}$ is the root node:
\enumsentence{ S$_{r}$.t:$\langle$conj$\rangle$ = disc}
\enumsentence{ S$_{c}$.b:$\langle$conj$\rangle$ = and/or/but/nil}


\section{Comparatives}
{\bf $\langle$compar$\rangle$}, possible values are {\bf +, --}\\
{\bf $\langle$equiv$\rangle$}, possible values are {\bf +, --}\\
{\bf $\langle$super$\rangle$}, possible values are {\bf +, --}

For detailed discussion see Chapter~\ref{compars-chapter}.

\section{Control}
{\bf $\langle$control$\rangle$} has no value and is used only for indexing
purposes.  The root node of every clausal tree has its {\bf
$\langle$control$\rangle$} feature coindexed with the control feature of
its subject.  This allows adjunct control to take place. In addition,
clauses that take infinitival clausal complements have the control feature
of their subject/object coindexed with the control feature of their
complement clause S, depending upon whether they are subject control verbs
or object control verbs respectively.


\section{Other Features}
{\bf $\langle$neg$\rangle$}, possible values are {\bf +, --}\\
Used for controlling the interaction of negation and auxiliary verbs.

\noindent
{\bf $\langle$pred$\rangle$}, possible values are {\bf +, --}\\
The {\bf $\langle$pred$\rangle$} feature is used in the following tree
families: Tnx0N1.trees and Tnx0nx1ARB.trees.
In the Tnx0N1.trees family, the following equations are used:\\
for $\alpha$W1nx0N1:

\enumsentence{ NP$_{1}$.t:$\langle$pred$\rangle$ = +}
\enumsentence{ NP$_{1}$.b:$\langle$pred$\rangle$ = +}
\enumsentence{ NP.t:$\langle$pred$\rangle$ = +}
\enumsentence{ N.t:$\langle$pred$\rangle$ = NP.b:$\langle$pred$\rangle$}

This is the only tree in this tree family to use the 
{\bf $\langle$pred$\rangle$} feature.

The other tree family where the {\bf $\langle$pred$\rangle$} feature is
used is Tnx0nx1ARB.trees.  Within this family, this feature (and the
following equations) are used only in the $\alpha$W1nx0nx1ARB tree.

\enumsentence{ AdvP$_{1}$.t:$\langle$pred$\rangle$ = +}
\enumsentence{ AdvP$_{1}$.b:$\langle$pred$\rangle$ = +}
\enumsentence{ NP.t:$\langle$pred$\rangle$ = +}
\enumsentence{ AdvP.b:$\langle$pred$\rangle$ = NP.t:$\langle$pred$\rangle$}

\noindent
{\bf $\langle$pron$\rangle$}, possible values are {\bf +, --}\\
This feature indicates whether a particular NP is a pronoun or not. 
Certain constructions which do not permit pronouns use this 
feature to block pronouns.

\noindent
{\bf $\langle$tense$\rangle$}, possible values are {\bf pres, past}\\
It does not seem to be the case that the {\bf $\langle$tense$\rangle$}
feature interacts with other features/syntactic processes. It 
comes from the lexicon with the verb and is transmitted up the
tree in such a way that the root S node ends up with the
tense feature of the highest verb in the tree. The equations
used for this purpose are:

\enumsentence{ {\bf S$_{r}$.b:$\langle$tense$\rangle$ = VP.t:$\langle$tense$\rangle$}}
\enumsentence{ {\bf VP.b:$\langle$tense$\rangle$ = V.t:$\langle$tense$\rangle$}}
