\chapter{Where to Find What} 
\label{table-intro} 
 
The two page table that follows gives an overview of what types of 
trees occur in various tree families with pointers to discussion in 
this report.  An entry in a cell of the table indicates that the 
tree(s) for the construction named in the row header are included in 
the tree family named in the column header. Entries are of two types. 
If the particular tree(s) are displayed and/or discussed in this 
report the entry gives a page number reference to the relevant 
discussion or figure.\footnote{Since Chapter~\ref{verb-classes} has a   brief discussion and a declarative tree for every tree family, page   references are given only for other sections in which discussion or   tree diagrams appear.}  Otherwise, a \xtagcheck \space indicates 
inclusion in the tree family but no figure or discussion related 
specifically to that tree in this report.  Blank cells indicate that 
there are no trees for the construction named in the row header in the 
tree family named in the column header.  Two tables are given below. 
The first one gives the expansion of abbreviations in the table 
headers. The second table gives the name given to each tree family in 
the actual XTAG grammar. This makes it easier to find the description 
of each tree family in Chapter~\ref{verb-classes} and to compare the 
description with the online XTAG grammar.
