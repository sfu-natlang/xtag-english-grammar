\chapter{Overview of the XTAG System} 
\label{overview} 
 
This section focuses on the various components that comprise the 
parser and English grammar in the XTAG system.  Persons interested 
only in the linguistic analyses in the grammar may skip this section 
without loss of continuity, although a quick glance at the tagset used 
in XTAG and the set of non-terminal labels used will be useful. We may 
occasionally refer back to the various components mentioned in this 
section. 
 
\section{System Description} 
 
Figure~{\ref{flowchart}} shows the overall flow of the system when 
parsing a sentence; a summary of each component is presented in 
Table~\ref{sys-table}. At the heart of the system is a parser for 
lexicalized TAGs (\cite{schabesjoshi88,schabes90}) which produces all 
legitimate parses for the sentence. The parser has two phases: {\bf Tree Selection} and {\bf Tree Grafting}.

\subsection{Tree Selection} 
 
Since we are working with lexicalized TAGs, each word in the sentence 
selects at least one tree. The advantage of a lexicalized formalism 
like LTAGs is that rather than parsing with all the trees in the 
grammar, we can parse with only the trees selected by the words in the 
input sentence. 
 
In the XTAG system, the selection of trees by the words is done in 
several steps. Each step attempts to reduce ambiguity, i.e. reduce the 
number of trees selected by the words in the sentence. 
 
\begin{description} 
\item[Morphological Analysis and POS Tagging] The input sentence is 
  first submitted to the {\bf Morphological Analyzer} and the {\bf     Tagger}. The morphological analyzer~(\cite{karp92}) consists of a 
  disk-based database (a compiled version of the derivational rules) 
  which is used to map an inflected word into its stem, part of speech 
  and feature equations corresponding to inflectional information. 
  These features are inserted at the anchor node of the tree 
  eventually selected by the stem. The POS Tagger can be disabled in 
  which case only information from the morphological analyzer is used. 
  The morphology data was originally extracted from the Collins 
  English Dictionary (\cite{ced79}) and Oxford Advanced Learner's 
  Dictionary (\cite{oald74}) available through ACL-DCI 
  (\cite{liberman89}), and then cleaned up and augmented by hand 
  (\cite{karp92}). 
    
\item[POS Blender] The output from the morphological analyzer and the 
  POS tagger go into the {\bf POS Blender} which uses the output of 
  the POS tagger as a filter on the output of the morphological 
  analyzer. Any words that are not found in the morphological database 
  are assigned the POS given by the tagger. 
  
\item[Syntactic Database] The syntactic database contains the mapping 
  between particular stem(s) and the tree templates or tree-families 
  stored in the {\bf Tree Database} (see Table~\ref{sys-table}). The 
  syntactic database also contains a list of feature equations that 
  capture lexical idiosyncrasies. The output of the POS Blender is 
  used to search the {\bf Syntactic Database} to produce a set of 
  lexicalized trees with the feature equations associated with the 
  word(s) in the syntactic database unified with the feature equations 
  associated with the trees. Note that the features in the syntactic 
  database can be assigned to any node in the tree and not just to the 
  anchor node. The syntactic database entries were originally 
  extracted from the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary 
  (\cite{oald74}) and Oxford Dictionary for Contemporary Idiomatic 
  English (\cite{cie75}) available through ACL-DCI 
  (\cite{liberman89}), and then modified and augmented by hand 
  (\cite{EgediMartin94}).  There are more than 31,000 syntactic 
  database entries.\footnote{This number does not include trees     assigned by default based on the part-of-speech of the word.} 
  Selected entries from this database are shown in 
  Table~\ref{syn-entries}. 
    
\item[Default Assignment] For words that are not found in the 
  syntactic database, default trees and tree-families are assigned 
  based on their POS tag. 
  
\item[Filters] Some of the lexicalized trees chosen in previous stages 
  can be eliminated in order to reduce ambiguity. Two methods are 
  currently used: structural filters which eliminate trees which have 
  impossible spans over the input sentence and a statistical filter 
  based on unigram probabilities of non-lexicalized trees (from a hand 
  corrected set of approximately 6000 parsed sentences). These methods 
  speed the runtime by approximately 87\%. 
  
\item[Supertagging] Before parsing, one can avail of an optional step 
  of {\em supertagging} the sentence. This step uses statistical 
  disambiguation to assign a unique elementary tree (or {\em     supertag}) to each word in the sentence. These assignments can 
  then be hand-corrected. These supertags are used as a filter on the 
  tree assignments made so far. More information on supertagging can 
  be found in (\cite{srini97diss,srini97iwpt}).

\end{table} 
 
\subsection{Tree Database} 
\label{tree-db} 
 
The {\bf Tree Database} contains the tree templates that are 
lexicalized by following the various steps given above. The lexical 
items are inserted into distinguished nodes in the tree template 
called the {\em anchor nodes}.  The part of speech of each word in the 
sentence corresponds to the label of the anchor node of the trees. 
Hence the tagset used by the POS Tagger corresponds exactly to the 
labels of the anchor nodes in the trees.  The tagset used in the XTAG 
system is given in Table~\ref{tagset}. The tree templates are 
subdivided into tree families (for verbs and other predicates), and 
tree files which are simply collections of trees for lexical items 
like prepositions, determiners, etc% 
\footnote{ The nonterminals in the tree database are {\tt A, AP, Ad,     AdvP, Comp, Conj, D, N, NP, P, PP, Punct, S, V, VP}.}% 
. 
 
\subsection{Tree Grafting} 
 
Once a particular set of lexicalized trees for the sentence have been 
selected, XTAG uses an Earley-style predictive left-to-right parsing 
algorithm for LTAGs (\cite{schabesjoshi88,schabes90}) to find all 
derivations for the sentence. The derivation trees and the associated 
derived trees can be viewed using the X-interface (see 
Table~\ref{sys-table}). The X-interface can also be used to save 
particular derivations to disk. 
 
The output of the parser for the sentence {\it I had a map on my desk} is 
illustrated in Figure~\ref{sentence}. The parse tree\footnote{The feature structures associated with each note of the parse tree are not shown here.} 
represents the surface constituent structure, while the derivation tree 
represents the derivation history of the parse. The nodes of the derivation 
tree are the tree names anchored by the lexical items\footnote{Appendix \ref{tree-naming} explains the conventions used in naming the trees.}.  The 
composition operation is indicated by the nature of the arcs: a dashed line is 
used for substitution and a bold line for adjunction.  The number beside each 
tree name is the address of the node at which the operation took place.  The 
derivation tree can also be interpreted as a dependency graph with unlabeled 
arcs between words of the sentence.

\subsection{The Grammar Development Environment} 
 
Working with and developing a large grammar is a challenging process, 
and the importance of having good visualization tools cannot be 
over-emphasized. Currently the XTAG system has X-windows based tools 
for viewing and updating the morphological and syntactic databases 
(\cite{karp92,EgediMartin94}). These are available in both ASCII and 
binary-encoded database format. The ASCII format is well-suited for 
various UNIX utilities (awk, sed, grep) while the database format is 
used for fast access during program execution.  However even the ASCII 
formatted representation is not well-suited for human readability. An 
X-windows interface for the databases allows users to easily examine 
them.  Searching for specific information on certain fields of the 
syntactic database is also available. Also, the interface allows a 
user to insert, delete and update any information in the databases. 
Figure~\ref{morphsyn-tool}(a) shows the interface for the morphology 
database and Figure~\ref{morphsyn-tool}(b) shows the interface for the 
syntactic database.

XTAG also has a parsing and grammar development interface 
(\cite{PSJ92}). This interface includes a tree editor, the ability to 
vary parameters in the parser, work with multiple grammars and/or 
parsers, and use metarules for more efficient tree editing and 
construction (\cite{becker94}). The interface is shown in 
Figure~\ref{xtag-interface}. It has the following features: 
 
\begin{itemize} 
 
\item Menu-based facility for creating and modifying tree files and 
loading grammar files. 
 
\item User controlled parser parameters, including the root 
category (main S, embedded S, NP, etc.), and the use of the tagger 
(on/off/retry on failure). 
 
\item Storage/retrieval facilities for elementary and parsed trees. 
 
\item The production of postscript files corresponding to elementary 
and parsed trees. 
 
\item Graphical displays of tree and feature data structures, 
including a scroll `web' for large tree structures. 
 
\item Mouse-based tree editor for creating and modifying trees and 
feature structures. 
 
\item Hand combination of trees by adjunction or substitution for use 
in diagnosing grammar problems. 
 
\item Metarule tool for automatic aid to the generation of trees by using 
tree-based transformation rules

\section{Computer Platform} 
 
 
XTAG was developed on the Sun SPARC station series. It has been tested 
on various Sun platforms including Ultra-1, Ultra-Enterprise. XTAG is 
freely available from the XTAG web page at {\tt   http://www.cis.upenn.edu/\~{}xtag/}. It requires 75 MB of disk space 
(once all binaries and databases are created after the install). XTAG 
requires the following software to run: 
 
\begin{itemize} 
  
\item A machine running UNIX and X11R4 (or higher). Previous releases 
  of X will not work. X11R4 is free software which usually comes 
  bundled with your OS. It is also freely available for various 
  platforms at {\tt http://www.xfree86.org/} 
  
\item A Common Lisp compiler which supports the latest definition of 
  Common Lisp (Steele's Common Lisp, second edition). XTAG has been 
  tested on Lucid Common Lisp/SPARC Solaris, Version: 4.2.1. Allegro 
  CL is no longer directly supported, however there have been third 
  party ports to recent versions of Allegro CL. 
  
\item CLX version 4 or higher. CLX is the Lisp equivalent to the Xlib 
  package written in C. 
  
\item Mark Kantrowitz's Lisp Utilities from CMU: logical-pathnames and 
  defsystem. 
 
\end{itemize} 
 
A patched version of CLX (Version 5.02) for SunOS 5.5.1 and the CMU 
Lisp Utilities are provided in our ftp directory for your convenience. 
However, we ask that you refer to the appropriate sources for updates. 
 
The morphology database component (\cite{karp92}), no longer under 
licensing restrictions, is available as a separate download from the 
XTAG web page (see above for URL). 
 
The syntactic database component is also available as part of the XTAG 
system (\cite{EgediMartin94}). 
 
More information can be obtained on the XTAG web page at \\
