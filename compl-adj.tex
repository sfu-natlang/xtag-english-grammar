\chapter{Underview}
\label{underview}

The morphological, syntactic, and tree databases together comprise the
English grammar\footnote{ See Chapter~\ref{overview} for details on
these levels of representation. }.  A lexical item that is not in the
databases receives a default tree selection and features for its part
of speech and morphology.  

In designing the grammar, a decision was made early on to err on the
side of acceptance whenever there are conflicting opinions as to
whether or not a construction is grammatical.  In this sense, the XTAG
English grammar is intended to function primarily as an acceptor
rather than a generator of English sentences.  The range of syntactic
phenomena that can be handled is large and includes auxiliaries
(including inversion), copula, raising and small clause constructions,
topicalization, relative clauses, infinitives, gerunds, passives,
adjuncts, it-clefts, wh-clefts, PRO constructions, noun-noun
modifications, determiner sequences, genitives, negation, noun-verb
contractions, clausal adjuncts and imperatives.

This chapter is meant to be an introductory look at grammar
organization in XTAG. It serves as basic information the reader would
need to read the more detailed information about the grammar in
subsequent parts of the technical report.

\section{Tree Families and Subcategorization Frames}
\label{subcat-frames}

Elementary trees for predicative words\footnote{ Such as non-auxiliary
verbs or predicative nouns. } are used to represent the linguistic
notion of subcategorization.  The anchor of the elementary tree
subcategorizes for the other elements that appear in the tree, forming
a clausal or sentential structure.  Tree families group together trees
that belong to the same subcategorization frame. Consider the
following uses of the verb {\it buy}:

\enumsentence{Srini bought a book.}
\enumsentence{Srini bought Beth a book.}

In sentence (\ex{-1}), the verb {\it buy} subcategorizes for a direct
object NP.  The elementary tree anchored by {\it buy} is shown in
Figure~\ref{subcat-trees}(a) and includes nodes for the NP complement
of {\it buy} and for the NP subject.  In addition to this declarative
tree structure, the tree family also contains the trees that would be
related to each other transformationally in a movement based approach,
i.e passivization, imperatives, wh-questions, relative clauses, and so
forth.  Each tree family selected by its anchor represents all the
various syntactic environments that it can appear in.

Sentence (\ex{0}) shows that {\it buy} also subcategorizes for
a double NP object.  This means that {\it buy} also selects the double
NP object subcategorization frame, or tree family, with its own set of
transformationally related sentence structures.
Figure~\ref{subcat-trees}(b) shows the declarative structure for this
set of sentence structures.

Entire classes of anchors select a tree family. All the transitive
verbs form a class which selects the transitive tree family. Recall
that a tree family is a group of trees related by some syntactic
transformations. Since an entire class of anchors are selecting this
tree family, the assumption is that these syntactic transformations
are valid for each member of this class. For instance, wh- extraction
is a syntactic transformation that will apply regardless of any
idiosyncratic properties of any particular anchor of the tree family.
Chapter~\ref{verb-classes} contains more information about
the different tree families in the grammar.

There are some syntactic transformations, however, that are sensitive
to the properties of a particular anchor within the same
subcategorization frame. The ergative (or transitive-inchoative)
alternation for transitive verbs is one such transformation. Only a
subset of the transitive verbs can undergo this transformation. A more
rigorous definition of tree family that accounts for such lexical
idiosyncrasies within an otherwise homogeneous family is discussed in
detail in Appendix~\ref{families}.

\section{Complements and Adjuncts}
\label{compl-adj}

Complements and adjuncts have very different structures in the XTAG grammar.
Complements are included in the elementary tree anchored by the verb that
selects them, while adjuncts do not originate in the same elementary tree as
the verb anchoring the sentence, but are instead added to a structure by
adjunction.  The contrasts between complements and adjuncts have been
extensively discussed in the linguistics literature and the classification of a
given element as one or the other remains a matter of debate (see
\cite{rizzi90},
\cite{larson88}, \cite{jackendoff90}, \cite{larson90}, \cite{cinque90}, 
\cite{obernauer84}, \cite{lasnik-saito84}, and \cite{chomsky86}).  The guiding
rule used in developing the XTAG grammar is whether or not the sentence is
ungrammatical without the questioned structure.\footnote{Iteration of a
structure can also be used as a diagnostic: {\it Srini bought a book at the
bookstore on Walnut Street for a friend}.} Consider the following
sentences:

\enumsentence{Srini bought a book.}
\enumsentence{Srini bought a book at the bookstore.}
\enumsentence{Fei ventured into the cave.}
\enumsentence{$\ast$Fei ventured.}

Prepositional phrases are common adjuncts, and when they are used as
adjuncts they have a tree structure such as that shown in
Figure~\ref{compl-adjunct}(a).  This adjunction tree would adjoin into
the tree shown in Figure~\ref{subcat-trees}(a) to generate sentence
(\ex{-2}).  There are verbs, however, such as {\it venture}, {\it
hunger} and {\it differentiate}, that take prepositional phrases as
complements.  Sentences (\ex{-1}) and (\ex{0}) clearly show that the
prepositional phrase are not optional for {\it venture}.
% For these
%sentences, the prepositional phrase will be an initial tree (as shown
%in Figure~\ref{compl-adjunct}(b)) that substitutes into an elementary
%tree, such as the one anchored by the verb {\it arrange} in
%Figure~\ref{compl-adjunct}(c).
For verbs such as this, the prepositional phrase is articulated within the
verb's elementary tree, as shown in Figure~\ref{compl-adjunct}(b). The
preposition and its complement noun phrase are substituted into this elementary
tree.

Virtually all parts of speech, except for main verbs, function as both
complements and adjuncts in the grammar.  More information is available in this
report on various parts of speech as complements: adjectives (e.g. section
\ref{nx0Vax1-family}), nouns (e.g.  section~\ref{nx0Vnx1-family}), and
prepositions (e.g. section~\ref{nx0Vpnx1-family}); and as adjuncts: adjectives
(section~\ref{adj-modifier}), adverbs (section~\ref{adv-modifier}), nouns
(section~\ref{noun-modifier}), and prepositions (section~\ref{prep-modifier}).

\section{Non-S constituents}

Although sentential trees are generally considered to be special cases
in any grammar, insofar as they make up a `starting category', it is
the case that any initial tree constitutes a phrasal constituent.
These initial trees may have substitution nodes that need to be filled
(by other initial trees), and may be modified by adjunct trees,
exactly as the trees rooted in S.  Although grouping is possible
according to the heads or anchors of these trees, we have not found
any classification similar to the subcategorization frames for verbs
that can be used by a lexical entry to create a tree family of the set
of trees selected by such entries.  These trees are selected one by
one by each lexical item, according to each lexical item's
idiosyncrasies.  The grammar described by this technical report places
them into several files for ease of use, but these files do not
constitute tree families in the way that the subcategorization frames
do.
