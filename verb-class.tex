\chapter{Verb Classes}
\label{verb-classes}

Each main\footnote{Auxiliary verbs are handled under a different mechanism.
See Chapter~\ref{auxiliaries} for details.} verb in the syntactic lexicon
selects at least one tree family\footnote{See section \ref{tree-db} for
explanation of tree families.} (subcategorization frame).  Since the tree
database and syntactic lexicon are already separated for space efficiency (see
Chapter~\ref{overview}), each verb can efficiently select a large number of
trees by specifying a tree family, as opposed to each of the individual trees.
This approach allows for a considerable reduction in the number of trees that
must be specified for any given verb or form of a verb.

There are currently 47 tree families in the system.\footnote{An explanation of
the naming convention used in naming the trees and tree families is available
in Appendix~\ref{tree-naming}.}  This chapter gives a brief description of each
tree family and shows the corresponding declarative tree\footnote{Before
lexicalization, the $\diamond$ indicates the anchor of the tree.}, along with
any peculiar characteristics or trees.  It also indicates which transformations
are in each tree family, and gives the number of verbs that select that
family.\footnote{Numbers given are as of August 1996 and are subject to some
change with further development of the grammar.} A few sample verbs are given,
along with example sentences.


\section{Intransitive: Tnx0V}\index{verbs, intransitive}
\label{nx0V-family}

\begin{description}

\item[Description:]  This tree family is selected by verbs that do not 
require an object complement of any type.  Adverbs, prepositional phrases and
other adjuncts may adjoin on, but are not required for the sentences to be
grammatical.  2,091 verbs select this family.

\item[Examples:]  {\it eat}, {\it sleep}, {\it dance} \\
{\it Al ate .} \\ 
{\it Seth slept .} \\ 
{\it Hyun danced .}

\item[Declarative tree:]  See Figure~\ref{nx0V-tree}.

\end{description}




\section{Transitive: Tnx0Vnx1}\index{verbs,transitive}
\label{nx0Vnx1-family}

\begin{description}

\item[Description:] This tree family is selected by verbs that require only an 
NP object complement.  The NP's may be complex structures, including gerund
NP's and NP's that take sentential complements.  This does not include light
verb constructions (see sections~\ref{nx0lVN1-family} and
\ref{nx0lVN1Pnx2-family}).  4,335 verbs select the transitive tree family.

\item[Examples:] {\it eat}, {\it dance}, {\it take}, {\it like}\\
{\it Al ate an apple .} \\ 
{\it Seth danced the tango .} \\ 
{\it Hyun is taking an algorithms course .} \\
{\it Anoop likes the fact that the semester is finished .}

\item[Other available trees:] wh-moved subject, wh-moved object, subject
relative clause, object relative clause, imperative, pre-sentential adjunct,
post-sentential adjunct, determiner gerund, NP gerund, passive with {\it by}
phrase, passive without {\it by} phrase, passive with wh-moved subject and {\it

wh-moved object out of the {\it by} phrase, passive with wh-moved {\it by}
phrase, passive with relative clause on subject and {\it by} phrase, passive
with relative clause on subject and no {\it by} phrase, passive with relative
clause on object on the {\it by} phrase, ergative, ergative with wh-moved
subject, ergative with subject relative clause.  In addition, two other trees
that allow transitive verbs to function as adjectives (e.g. {\it the stopped
truck}) are also in the family.

\end{description}





\section{Transitive Idioms: Tnx0Vdn1}\index{verbs,idiomatic}
\label{nx0Vdn1-family}

\begin{description}

\item[Description:]  This tree family is selected by idiomatic phrases in which
the verb, determiner, and NP are all frozen (as in {\it He kicked the
bucket.}).  Only a limited number of transformations are allowed, as compared
to the normal transitive tree family (see section~\ref{nx0Vnx1-family}).  The
analysis of idioms has not been done for idioms in general; this tree is
included to illustrate how they could be handled in XTAG.  Other idioms that
have the same structure as {\it kick the bucket}, and that are limited to the
same transformations would select this tree, while different tree families
would be needed to handle other idioms.  Note that {\it John kicked the bucket}
is actually ambiguous, and would result in two parses - an idiom (meaning that
John died), a simple transitive sentences (meaning that there is an physical
bucket that John hit with his foot).

\item[Examples:] {\it kick the bucket} \\
{\it Nixon kicked the bucket .}

\item[Declarative tree:]  See Figure~\ref{nx0Vdn1-tree}.

\section{Ditransitive: Tnx0Vnx1nx2}\index{verbs,ditransitive}
\label{nx0Vnx1nx2-family}

\begin{description}

\item[Description:]  This tree family is selected by verbs that take exactly 
two NP complements.  It does {\bf not} include verbs that undergo the
ditransitive verb shift (see section~\ref{nx0Vnx1Pnx2-family}).  The apparent
ditransitive alternates involving verbs in this class and benefactive PP's
(e.g. {\it John baked a cake for Mary}) are analyzed as transitives (see
section~\ref{nx0Vnx1-family}) with a PP adjunct. Benefactives are
taken to be adjunct PP's because they are optional (e.g. {\it John baked a
cake} vs. {\it John baked a cake for Mary}).  54 verbs select the ditransitive
tree family.

\item[Examples:] {\it ask}, {\it cook}, {\it win} \\
{\it Christy asked Mike a question .} \\ 
{\it Doug cooked his father dinner .} \\
{\it Dania won her sister a stuffed animal .}

\section{Ditransitive with PP: Tnx0Vnx1pnx2}\index{verbs, NP with VP verbs}
\label{nx0Vnx1pnx2-family}

\begin{description}

\item[Description:]  This tree family is selected by ditransitive verbs that
take a noun phrase followed by a prepositional phrase.  The preposition is not
constrained.  The preposition must be required and not optional - that is, the
sentence must be ungrammatical with just the noun phrase (e.g. {\it $\ast$John
put the table}).  No verbs, therefore, should select both this tree family and
the transitive tree family (see section~\ref{nx0Vnx1-family}).  This tree
family is also distinguished from the ditransitive verbs, such as {\it give},
that undergo verb shifting (see section~\ref{nx0Vnx1Pnx2-family}).  There are
61 verbs that select this tree family.

\item[Examples:] {\it associate}, {\it put}, {\it refer} \\
{\it Rostenkowski associated money with power .}   \\
{\it He put his reputation on the line .}  \\
{\it He referred all questions to his attorney .}

\section{Ditransitive with PP shift: Tnx0Vnx1Pnx2}\index{verbs,ditransitive
with PP shift}
\label{nx0Vnx1Pnx2-family}

\begin{description}

\item[Description:]  This tree family is selected by ditransitive verbs that
undergo a shift to a {\it to} prepositional phrase.  These ditransitive verbs
are clearly constrained so that when they shift, the prepositional phrase must
start with {\it to}.  This is in contrast to the Ditransitives with PP in
section~\ref{nx0Vnx1pnx2-family}, in which verbs may appear in [NP V NP PP]
constructions with a variety of prepositions.  Both the dative shifted and
non-shifted PP complement trees are included.  55 verbs select this family.

\item[Examples:] {\it give}, {\it promise}, {\it tell} \\
{\it Bill gave Hillary flowers .} \\ 
{\it Bill gave flowers to Hillary .} \\
{\it Whitman promised the voters a tax cut .} \\
{\it Whitman promised a tax cut to the voters .} \\

\section{Sentential Complement with NP: Tnx0Vnx1s2}\index{verbs,Sentential
Complement with NP} 
\label{nx0Vnx1s2-family}

\begin{description}

\item[Description:]  This tree family is selected by verbs that take both an NP
and a sentential complement.  The sentential complement may be infinitive or
indicative.  The type of clause is specified by each individual verb in its
syntactic lexicon entry.  A given verb may select more than one type of
sentential complement.  The declarative tree, and many other trees in this
family, are auxiliary trees, as opposed to the more common initial trees.
These auxiliary trees adjoin onto an S node in an existing tree of the type
specified by the sentential complement.  This is the mechanism by which TAGs
are able to maintain long-distance dependencies (see Chapter~\ref{extraction}),
even over multiple embeddings (e.g. {\it What did Bill tell Mary that John
said?}).  106 verbs select this tree family.

\item[Examples:] {\it beg}, {\it expect}, {\it tell} \\
{\it Srini begged Mark to increase his disk quota .} \\
{\it Jim expected Beth to feed the dogs .} \\
{\it Beth told Jim that it was his turn .}

\section{Intransitive Verb Particle: Tnx0Vpl}\index{verbs,verb-particle,intransitive}
\label{nx0Vpl}

\begin{description}

\item[Description:]  The trees in this tree family are anchored by both the
verb and the verb particle.  Both appear in the syntactic lexicon and together
select this tree family.  Intransitive verb particles can be difficult to
distinguish from intransitive verbs with adverbs adjoined on. The main
diagnostics for including verbs in this class are whether the meaning is
compositional or not, and whether there is a transitive version of the
verb/verb particle combination with the same or similar meaning.  The existence
of an alternate compositional meaning is a strong indication for a separate
verb particle construction.  There are 164 verb/verb particle combinations.

\item[Examples:] {\it add up}, {\it come out}, {\it sign off} \\
{\it The numbers never quite added up .} \\
{\it John finally came out (of the closet) .} \\
{\it I think that I will sign off now .}

\section{Transitive Verb Particle: Tnx0Vplnx1}\index{verbs,particle,transitive}
\label{nx0Vplnx1-family}

\begin{description}

\item[Description:]  Verb/verb particle combinations that take an NP complement
select this tree family.  Both the verb and the verb particle are anchors of
the trees. Particle movement has been taken as the diagnostic to distinguish
verb particle constructions from intransitives with adjoined PP's.  If the
alleged particle is able to undergo particle movement, in other words appear
both before and after the direct object, then it is judged to be a particle.
Items that do not undergo particle movement are taken to be prepositions.  In
many, but not all, of the verb particle cases, there is also an alternate
prepositional meaning in which the lexical item did not move.  (e.g. {\it He
looked up the number (in the phonebook).  He looked the number up. Srini looked
up the road (for Purnima's car).  $\ast$He looked the road up.})  There are 841
verb/verb particle combinations.

\item[Examples:] {\it blow off}, {\it make up}, {\it pick out} \\
{\it He blew off his linguistics class for the third time .} \\
{\it He blew his linguistics class off for the third time .} \\
{\it The dyslexic leprechaun made up the syntactic lexicon .} \\
{\it The dyslexic leprechaun made the syntactic lexicon up .} \\
{\it I would like to pick out a new computer .} \\

\item[Description:]  Verb/verb particle combinations that select this tree
family take 2 NP complements.  Both the verb and the verb particle anchor the
trees, and the verb particle can occur before, between, or after the noun
phrases.  Perhaps because of the complexity of the sentence, these verbs do not
seem to have passive alternations ({\it $\ast$A new bank account was opened up
Michelle by me}).  There are 4 verb/verb particle combinations that select
this tree family.  The exhaustive list is given in the examples.

\item[Examples:] {\it dish out}, {\it open up}, {\it pay off}, {\it rustle up}

\section{Intransitive with PP: Tnx0Vpnx1}\index{verbs,intransitive with PP}
\label{nx0Vpnx1-family}
\begin{description}

\item[Description:]  The verbs that select this tree family are not strictly 
intransitive, in that they {\bf must} be followed by a prepositional phrase.
Verbs that are intransitive and simply {\bf can} be followed by a prepositional
phrase do not select this family, but instead have the PP adjoin onto the
intransitive sentence.  Accordingly, there should be no verbs in both this
class and the intransitive tree family (see section~\ref{nx0V-family}).  The
prepositional phrase is not restricted to being headed by any particular
lexical item.  Note that these are not transitive verb particles (see
section~\ref{nx0Vplnx1-family}), since the head of the PP does not move.  171
verbs select this tree family.

\item[Examples:] {\it grab}, {\it impinge}, {\it provide} \\
{\it Seth grabbed for the brass ring .} \\
{\it The noise gradually impinged on Dania's thoughts .} \\
{\it A good host provides for everyone's needs .}

\section{Sentential Complement: Tnx0Vs1}\label{verbs,sentential complement}
\label{nx0Vs1-family}

\begin{description}

\item[Description:]  This tree family is selected by verbs that take just a
sentential complement.  The sentential complement may be of type infinitive,
indicative, or small clause (see Chapter~\ref{small-clauses}).  The type of
clause is specified by each individual verb in its syntactic lexicon entry, and
a given verb may select more than one type of sentential complement.  The
declarative tree, and many other trees in this family, are auxiliary trees, as
opposed to the more common initial trees.  These auxiliary trees adjoin onto an
S node in an existing tree of the type specified by the sentential complement.
This is the mechanism by which TAGs are able to maintain long-distance
dependencies (see Chapter~\ref{extraction}), even over multiple embeddings
(e.g. {\it What did Bill think that John said?}). 318 verbs select this tree
family.

\item[Examples:]  {\it consider}, {\it think} \\
{\it Dania considered the algorithm unworkable .}\\
{\it Srini thought that the program was working .} \\

\section{Intransitive with Adjective: Tnx0Va1}\index{verbs,intransitive with adjective}
\label{nx0Va1-family}

\begin{description}

\item[Description:]  The verbs that select this tree family take an adjective
as a complement.  The adjective may be regular, comparative, or superlative.
It may also be formed from the special class of adjectives derived from the
transitive verbs (e.g. {\it agitated, broken}).  See
section~\ref{nx0Vnx1-family}).  Unlike the Intransitive with PP verbs (see
section~\ref{nx0Vpnx1-family}), some of these verbs may also occur as bare
intransitives as well.  This distinction is drawn because adjectives do not
normally adjoin onto sentences, as prepositional phrases do.  Other
intransitive verbs can only occur with the adjective, and these select only
this family.  The verb class is also distinguished from the adjective small
clauses (see section~\ref{nx0Ax1-family}) because these verbs are not raising
verbs.  34 verbs select this tree family.

{\it The greenhouse became hotter .} \\
{\it The plants grew tall and strong .} \\

\begin{description}

\item[Description:] The verbs that select this tree family all take sentential
subjects, and are often referred to as `psych' verbs, since they all refer to
some psychological state of mind.  The sentential subject can be indicative
(complementizer required) or infinitive (complementizer optional).
 100 verbs that select this tree family.

\item[Examples:] {\it delight}, {\it impress}, {\it surprise} \\
{\it that the tea had rosehips in it delighted Christy .} \\

\section{Light Verbs: Tnx0lVN1, Tnx0lVdN1}\index{verbs, light}
\label{nx0lVN1-family}

\begin{description}

\item[Description:] The verb/noun pairs that select these tree families are 
pairs in which the interpretation is non-compositional and the noun contributes
argument structure to the predicate (e.g. {\it The man took a walk.} vs. {\it
The man took a radio}).  The verb and the noun occur together in the syntactic
database, and both anchor the trees.  The verbs in the light verb constructions
are {\it do}, {\it give}, {\it have}, {\it make} and {\it take}.  The noun
following the light verb is (usually) in a bare infinitive form ({\it have a
good cry}) and usually occurs with {\it a(n)}.  However, we include deverbal
nominals ({\it take a bath}, {\it give a demonstration}) as well.
Constructions with nouns that do not contribute an argument structure ({\it
have a cigarette}, {\it give} NP {\it a black eye}) are excluded.  In addition
to semantic considerations of light verbs, they differ syntactically from
Transitive verbs (section~\ref{nx0Vnx1-family}) as well in that the noun in the
light verb construction does not extract.  Because the noun is an anchor in the
tree, there are two different tree families representing nouns that require
determiners and those that occur without them (see
Chapter~\ref{det-comparitives}).  There are 96 verb/noun pairs that select the
light verb tree without determiners, and 242 that select the light verb tree
with determiners.

\item[Examples:] {\it give groan}, {\it have discussion}, {\it make comment} \\
{\it The audience gave a collective groan .} \\
{\it We had a big discussion about closing the libraries .} \\
{\it The professors made comments on the paper .}

\section{Ditransitive Light Verbs with PP Shift: Tnx0lVN1Pnx2, Tnx0lVdN1Pnx2}\index{verbs,ditransitive light verbs with PP shift}
\label{nx0lVN1Pnx2-family}

\begin{description}

\item[Description:]  The verb/noun pairs that select these tree families are 
pairs in which the interpretation is non-compositional and the noun contributes
argument structure to the predicate (e.g. {\it Dania made Srini a cake.} vs.
{\it Dania made Srini a loan}).  The verb and the noun occur together in the
syntactic database, and both anchor the trees.  The verbs in these light verb
constructions are {\it give} and {\it make}.  The noun following the light verb
is (usually) a bare infinitive form (e.g. {\it make a promise to Anoop}).
However, we include deverbal nominals (e.g. {\it make a payment to Anoop}) as
well.  Constructions with nouns that do not contribute an argument structure
are excluded.  In addition to semantic considerations of light verbs, they
differ syntactically from the Ditransitive with PP Shift verbs (see
section~\ref{nx0Vnx1Pnx2-family}) as well in that the noun in the light verb
construction does not extract.  Also, passivization is severely restricted.
Because the noun is an anchor in the tree, there are two different tree
families representing nouns that require determiners and those that occur
without them (see Chapter~\ref{det-comparitives}).  There are 10 verb/noun
pairs that select the trees without determiners, and 18 that select the trees
with determiners.

\item[Examples:] {\it give look}, {\it give wave}, {\it make promise} \\
{\it Dania gave Carl a murderous look .} \\
{\it Amanda gave us a little wave as she left .} \\
{\it Dania made Doug a promise .}

\section{Locative Small Clause with Ad anchor: Tnx0nx1ARB}
\label{nx0nx1ARB-family}

\begin{description}

\item[Description:]  These trees are not anchored by verbs, but by adverbs 
that are part of locative adverbial phrases. Locatives are explained 
in much greater detail in the section on the locative modifier trees
(see section~\ref{locatives}). The only remarkable aspect of this tree 
family is the wh-moved locative tree, $\alpha$W1nx0nx1ARB, shown in Figure 
\ref{W1nx0nx1ARB-tree}. This is the only tree family with this type of 
transformation, in which the entire adverbial phrase is wh-moved but not all 
elements are replaced by wh items (as in {\it how many city blocks away 
is the record store?}). Locatives that consist of just the locative adverb 
or the locative adverb and a degree adverb (see Section \ref{locatives} for 
details) are treated as exhaustive PPs and therefore select that tree 
family (Section \ref{nx0Px1-family}) when used predicatively. For an 
extensive description of small clauses, see 
section~\ref{sm-clause-xtag-analysis}. 26 adverbs select this tree family.

\item[Examples:] {\it ahead}, {\it offshore}, {\it behind} \\
{\it the crash is three blocks ahead} \\
{\it the naval battle was many kilometers offshore} \\
{\it how many blocks behind was Max?} \\

\section{Exceptional Case Marking: Tnx0Vs1}\index{verbs,ecm}
\label{Xnx0Vs1-family}

\begin{description}

\item[Description:]  This tree family is selected by verbs that are classified
as exceptional case marking, meaning that the verb asssigns accusative case
to the subject of the sentential complement.  This is in contrast to verbs
in the Tnx0Vnx1s2 family (section~\ref{nx0Vnx1s2-family}), which assign 
accusative
case to a NP which is not part of the sentential complement.  ECM verbs
take sentential complements which are either an infinitive or a ``bare''
infinitive.  As with the Tnx0Vs1 family (section~\ref{nx0Vs1-family}), the
declarative and other trees in the Xnx0Vs1 family are auxiliary trees, as
opposed to the more common initial trees.  These auxiliary trees adjoin onto an
S node in an existing tree of the type specified by the sentential complement.
This is the mechanism by which TAGs are able to maintain long-distance
dependencies (see Chapter~\ref{extraction}), even over multiple embeddings
(e.g. {\it Who did Bill expect to eat beans?}) or 
{\it who did Bill expect Mary to like?}  See section~\ref{ecm-verbs} 
for details on this family.  17 verbs select this tree family.

\item[Examples:]  {\it expect}, {\it see} \\
{\it Van expects Bob to talk .}
{\it Bob sees the harmonica fall .}

\item[Declarative tree:]  See Figure~\ref{Xnx0Vs1-tree}.
